# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abe

**Backend developer** / **Sysadmin** / **DevOps** person from the Netherlands.

I started coding as a kid in roughly Y2K and followed this up with a Bachelors
in **Computer Science** at [NHL Stenden](https://nhlstenden.com/en/) university of applied sciences.

In 2012 I became a professional developer, while slowly drifting towards **Linux** system administration and **DevOps**
work.

I'm currently employed as a full time engineer at
[XpressionLabs](https://xpressionlabs.nl), where we make brand-management
software for over 60.000 users. Our software facilitates the designing, ordering
and printing of over 90.000 products.

My responsibilities include:

- Monitoring, provisioning and supporting ~30 servers
- Technical support for our software
- CI/CD
- Quality assurance
- Backups and recovery
- Database management
- Technical implementation of [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)
